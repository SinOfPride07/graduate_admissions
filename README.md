# Graduate Admissons Predictor using STREAMLIT

##Deploying ML models in a web app is usually done through Flask, but **Streamlit** seems to be a bit faster and better than Flask.
##You can try out the web app [here](https://grad-adm.herokuapp.com/).

The dataset for this project was taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions) and the algorithm used here is the Random Forest Regressor.

The main aim of this project was to try if streamlit is faster than flask so that a ML enthusiast could focus more on development of the model rather than the web app.
